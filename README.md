# Capstone Design
## Implement of Indoor Object Seeking Robot
* Robot os: ROS kinetic
* Remote PC os: Ubuntu 16.04
* Hardware: turtlebot3 Waffle Pi 
* Algorithm: Active Neural Slam Algorithm
### Project Goal
* Understanding and Using SLAM
* Mapping and Localization by using Active Neural Slam [here](https://github.com/devendrachaplot/Neural-SLAM)
* Object Detection by using YOLO [here](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)
### Method
* Environment: habitat-sim
* Exchange data with Turtlebot (ex. sensor data)
